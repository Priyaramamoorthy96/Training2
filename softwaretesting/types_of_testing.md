##### BLACKBOX TESTING
Black box testing is defined as a testing technique in which functionality of the Application Under Test (AUT) is tested without looking at the internal code structure, implementation details and knowledge of internal paths of the software. This type of testing is based entirely on software requirements and specifications.
In BlackBox Testing we just focus on inputs and output of the software system without bothering about internal knowledge of the software program.
For Example, an operating system like Windows, a website like Google, a database like Oracle or even your own custom application. Under Black Box Testing, you can test these applications by just focusing on the inputs and outputs without knowing their internal code implementation. 
How to do BlackBox Testing : 
Here are the generic steps followed to carry out any type of Black Box Testing.

- Initially, the requirements and specifications of the system are examined.
- Tester chooses valid inputs (positive test scenario) to check whether SUT processes them correctly. Also, some invalid inputs (negative test scenario) are chosen to verify that the SUT is able to detect them.
- Tester determines expected outputs for all those inputs.
- Software tester constructs test cases with the selected inputs.
- The test cases are executed.
- Software tester compares the actual outputs with the expected outputs.
- Defects if any are fixed and re-tested.

##### WHITE BOX TESTING 
White Box Testing is defined as the testing of a software solution's internal structure, design, and coding. In this type of testing, the code is visible to the tester. It focuses primarily on verifying the flow of inputs and outputs through the application, improving design and usability, strengthening security. White box testing is also known as Clear Box testing, Open Box testing, Structural testing, Transparent Box testing, Code-Based testing, and Glass Box testing. It is usually performed by developers.

White box testing involves the testing of the software code for the following:
- Internal security holes
- Broken or poorly structured paths in the coding processes
- The flow of specific inputs through the code
- Expected output
- The functionality of conditional loops
- Testing of each statement, object, and function on an individual basis

##### UNIT TESTING
Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc. In object-oriented programming, the smallest unit is a method, which may belong to a base/ super class, abstract class or derived/ child class. (Some treat a module of an application as a unit. This is to be discouraged as there will probably be many individual units within that module.) Unit testing frameworks, drivers, stubs, and mock/ fake objects are used to assist in unit testing
##### SYSTEM TESTING
System Testing (ST) is a black box testing technique performed to evaluate the complete system the system's compliance against specified requirements. In System testing, the functionalities of the system are tested from an end-to-end perspective.
System Testing is usually carried out by a team that is independent of the development team in order to measure the quality of the system unbiased. It includes both functional and Non-Functional testing.

- It is basically a part of software testing and test plan should always contain specific space for this testing.
- To test the system as a whole, requirements and expectations should be clear and the tester needs to understand the real-time usage of application too.
- Also, most used third-party tools, version of OSes, flavours and architecture of OSes can affect systemâ€™s functionality, performance, security, recoverability or installability.
- Therefore, while testing system a clear picture of how the application is going to be used and what kind of issues it can face in real time can be helpful. In addition to that, a requirements document is as important as understanding the application.
- Clear and updated requirements document can save tester from a number of misunderstandings, assumptions and questions.
- In short, a pointed and crisp requirement document with latest updates along with an understanding of real-time application usage can make ST more fruitful.
- This testing is done in a planned and systematic manner.

##### INTEGRATION TESTING
Upon completion of unit testing, the units or modules are to be integrated which gives raise to integration testing. The purpose of integration testing is to verify the functional, performance, and reliability between the modules that are integrated.
Integration Strategies:
- Big-Bang Integration : Big bang approach integrates all the modules in one go i.e. it does not go for integrating the modules one by one. It verifies if the system works as expected or not once integrated. If any issue is detected in the completely integrated module, then it becomes difficult to find out which module has caused the issue.

- Top Down Integration : This technique starts from the topmost module and gradually progress towards the lower modules. Only the top module is unit tested in isolation. After this, the lower modules are integrated one by one. The process is repeated until all the modules are integrated and tested.

- Bottom Up Integration : Bottom-up testing, as the name suggests starts from the lowest or the innermost unit of the application, and gradually moves up. The Integration testing starts from the lowest module and gradually progresses towards the upper modules of the application. This integration continues till all the modules are integrated and the entire application is tested as a single unit.
- Hybrid Integration : We know that Integration Testing is a phase in software testing in which standalone modules are combined and tested as a single entity. During that phase, the interface and the communication between each one of those modules are tested. There are two popular approaches for Integration testing which is Top down Integration Testing and Bottom up Integration Testing. In Hybrid Integration Testing, we exploit the advantages of Top-down and Bottom-up approaches. As the name suggests, we make use of both the Integration techniques.

##### ACCEPTANCE TEST

Acceptance testing, a testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications. The main purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and verify if it is has met the required criteria for delivery to end users.
- User acceptance Testing : In software development, user acceptance testing (UAT) - also called beta testing, application testing, and end user testing - is a phase of software development in which the software is tested in the "real world" by the intended audience.
